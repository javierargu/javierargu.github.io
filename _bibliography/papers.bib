	abstract = {Squeezing of optical fields, used as a powerful resource for many applications, and the radiation properties in the process of high harmonic generation have thus far been considered separately. In this Letter, we want to clarify that the joint quantum state of all the optical field modes in the process of high harmonic generation is in general entangled and squeezed. We show that this is already the case in the simplest scenario of driving uncorrelated atoms by a classical laser light field. The previous observation of product coherent states after the high harmonic generation process is a consequence of the assumption that the ground state depletion can be neglected, which is related to vanishing dipole moment correlations. Furthermore, we analyze how the resulting quadrature squeezing in the fundamental laser mode after the interaction can be controlled and explicitly show that all field modes are entangled.},

The concept of synthetic dimensions works particularly well in atomic physics, quantum optics, and photonics, where the internal degrees of freedom (Zeeman sublevels of the ground state, metastable excited states, or motional states for atoms, and angular momentum states or transverse modes for photons) provide the synthetic space. We describe our attempts to design quantum simulators with synthetic dimensions, to mimic curved spaces, artificial gauge fields, lattice gauge theories, twistronics, quantum random walks, and more.},

Argüello-Luengo et al., Nature (London) 574, 215 (2019)], ultracold fermionic atoms have been proposed for this purpose by showing us how to simulate in an analog way the quantum chemistry Hamiltonian projected in a lattice basis set. Here, we continue exploring this path and go beyond these results in several ways. First, we numerically benchmark the working conditions of the analog simulator and find less demanding experimental setups where chemistry-like behavior in three dimensions can still be observed. We also provide a deeper understanding of the errors of the simulation appearing due to discretization and finite-size effects and provide a way to mitigate them. Finally, we benchmark the simulator characterizing the behavior of two-electron atoms (He) and molecules (HeH+) beyond the example considered in the original work.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the recent progress in realizing and controlling extended Bose-Hubbard systems using excitonic or atomic devices, the present Letter theoretically investigates the case of a two-band Bose-Hubbard chain with nearest-neighbor interactions. Specifically, this study concentrates on the scenario where, due to the interactions, one band supports a density-wave phase, i.e., a correlated insulating phase with spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry in the lattice, while the other band supports superfluid behavior. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we show that supersolid order can emerge from such a combination, that is, an elusive quantum state that combines crystalline order with long-range phase coherence. Depending on the filling of the bands and the interband interaction strength, the supersolid phase competes with phase-separation, superfluid order, or Mott insulating density-wave order. As a possible setup to observe supersolidity, we propose the combination of a lower band supporting density-wave order and a thermally excited band that supports superfluidity due to weaker lattice confinement.},

	abstract = {The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is a successful theory that establishes the criteria for ergodicity and thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems. In this work, we investigate the thermalization properties of a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with linearly inhomogeneous interactions. We demonstrate that introduction of the inhomogeneous interactions leads to an onset of quantum chaos and thermalization, which, however, becomes inhibited for sufficiently strong inhomogeneity. To exhibit ETH, and to display its breakdown upon varying the strength of interactions, we probe statistics of energy levels and properties of matrix elements of local observables in eigenstates of the inhomogeneous XXZ spin chain. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the entanglement entropy and the survival probability which further evidence the thermalization and its breakdown in the considered model. We outline a way to experimentally realize the XXZ chain with linearly inhomogeneous interactions in systems of ultracold atoms. Our results highlight a mechanism of emergence of ETH due to insertion of inhomogeneities in an otherwise integrable system and illustrate the arrest of quantum dynamics in the presence of strong interactions.},
